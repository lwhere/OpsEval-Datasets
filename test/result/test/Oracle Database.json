The column needs to support date arithmetic without using conversion functions. This suggests that we need a data type that can perform date calculations,such as adding or subtracting days.\n2. The loan period is up to 10 years,which implies that we need a data type that can store a large range of dates.\n3. The column is used for calculating interest for the number of days the loan remains unpaid,which means we need a data type that can accurately store the number of days.\n\nBased on these requirements,I believe that using a TIMESTAMP data type (option B) would allow us to perform date arithmetic and store a large range of dates. Additionally,using an INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH data type (option D) would allow us to store the loan period in a more precise manner,which would be useful for calculating interest.\n\nSo,my answer is: B,D"

This gives me `01101111`,which is the two's complement of the original value of X.\n\nConverting this back to decimal,I get `55`. Since this is a positive value,I'll subtract it from 256 (the maximum value a byte can hold) to get the two's complement of the negative value of X,which is `-101`.\n\nNow,I'll convert this to hexadecimal: `FFD1`.
