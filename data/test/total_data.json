        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "solution": "If Alice suspects that a DNS server is not resolving hostnames, she should try connecting to a remote host using the Internet Protocol (IP) address instead of the name. If she can connect, she knows that all internal Local Area Network (LAN) components and the Internet gateway are functioning, and the remote host is functioning. The problem most likely lies within the DNS server itself. If Alice cannot connect to a remote host using the IP address, the problem is not the DNS server. She would need to do more testing to isolate the problem device and the affected area. `ipconfig` is a workstation command that enables you to verify the local IP configuration; it is not used to test a DNS server's functionality. Using the `ping` command will only tell you whether the computer hosting the DNS service is functioning at the network layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model; it will not test the DNS service functionality. The `tracert` (or `traceroute` ) command is used to identify the hop-by-hop path taken to reach a destination; it does not allow you to test functionality above the network layer of the OSI model",

You would likely want a global unicast address on a web server, but not on your workstation. Link-local addresses can only be used to communicate with devices that are on the same local link. They will start with fe80 and are assigned in a manner similar to IPv4 APIPA addresses. The IPv6 loopback address is ::1, and is used for testing just like the loopback address in IPv4 (127.0.0.1). A unique local address is akin to an IPv4 private address. Unique local addresses are nonroutable, so a computer with only a unique local address and a link-local address (but no global unicast address) would need a router with IPv6 NAT in order to access the Internet",

        "question": "Ralph has been hired by a company to redesign its Local Area Network (LAN). Right now, it has a single 100 Mbps Ethernet LAN with 40 users and 2 shared servers, all connected through 3 hubs. The users on the network must be able to share files with one another and also access the shared servers. The users are complaining that the network is too slow. Management states that cost is a factor that must be considered. Which of the following upgrade scenarios should Ralph recommend in this situation?\n\nA. Split the network into smaller segments with dedicated hubs as opposed to shared hubs. B. Split the network into two routed LANs with 20 users each. C. Replace the hubs with switches to define separate collision domains and filter unnecessary traffic from each segment. D. Replace the hubs with a layer 3 switch and define two Virtual LANs (VLANs) with 20 users each. ",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "solution": "The best choice is to replace the hubs with switches, since the network is relatively small, and cost is an issue. On the existing network, all users share the same 100 Mbps communication channel, and each computer must take turns transmitting. By replacing the hubs with switches, you provide each computer with a dedicated 100 Mbps connection to the switch, while reducing unnecessary traffic and collisions on the network. There is no such thing as a dedicated hub. Splitting the network into two routed LANs is not the best solution, because all users must share information on a constant basis. Also, cost is a factor, and routers are more expensive than switches. Replacing the hubs with a layer 3 switch and defining two VLANs with 20 users each is not a reasonable solution, because layer 3 switches are very expensive",

            "Have your coworker print the configuration page."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "solution": "**Explanation:** In DHCP, set a reservation based on the MAC address. In this scenario, the clients are most likely connecting to the printer by using the IP address. Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) can be used in this manner. By default, the moment the new printer is connected to the network, it acquires an IP address from the DHCP server; this is a new IP address that is different from the one used by the old printer. This causes the clients to fail when attempting to connect and print to the new printer. To prevent this problem, you can go to the router (or another DHCP device) and configure a MAC address reservation. The MAC address of the printer (which might be on a label or might be accessible from the onscreen display) can be plugged into the DHCP server and reserved to a specific IP address. Of course, a better option would be to simply configure the printer to use a static IP address.\n\n **Incorrect answers:** Renaming the printer with the old name doesn\u2019t help because the client computers are most likely connecting via IP address, not via name. Printing the configuration page is great and might help you to figure out what the problem could be, but it doesn\u2019t actually solve the problem!",

Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only channels that are far enough apart from each other to avoid any overlap with the adjacent channels. This is why they are often recommended. However, in Ralph's case, these channels are too crowded with other networks. Ralph should therefore use a channel that is as far as possible from the crowded ones.

Which of the following is not one of the ways in which these types of multiplexing differ?\n\nA. They use different wavelength spacings. B. They carry different numbers of channels on a single medium. C. They provide different amounts of signal amplification. D. None of the above. ",

Scaling is the network design use case that focuses on the scalability of the technology or holistic architecture in question. This could be as simple as a single flat area 0 OSPF design that just doesn\u2019t scale anymore to the business requirements, in which case you could leverage multiple areas, multiple area types, and LSA filtering techniques to help increase the scalability. In a design failure use case, there is a problem, and you have to resolve it. For example, not aligning the critical roles of Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP). If your STP root bridge and your FHRP default gateways are not aligned to the correct devices, then you would have a suboptimal routing issue that would eventually lead to a design failure.

        "question": "Ralph is responsible for the network installation in a new building purchased by his company, and he has elected to have Category 6 (Cat 6) Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) cable installed. The company president has asked him if it is possible to run their Gigabit Ethernet network using two of the wire pairs in the cable, while using the other two pairs for telephone connections. Ralph is not sure, so he sets up a lab network using cables with only two pairs connected. When he plugs computers into the switch and turns them on, the Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) labeled 1000 light up, indicating that a Gigabit Ethernet connection has been established. Ralph gets excited at the thought of how much money he might save the company by using the same cable for both telephone and data. However, while the LED is lit, he cannot seem to connect to another system over his test network. Which of the following describes what he must do to correct the problem?\n\nA. Ralph must manually configure the network adapters to use Gigabit Ethernet, rather than let them autonegotiate. B. Ralph is using the wrong two wire pairs for the Gigabit Ethernet connection. He must rewire the connectors. C. Ralph is using the wrong pinout standard on his lab network. He must use T568A. D. Ralph must use all four wire pairs for a Gigabit Ethernet connection. ",

A cold site is just a space at a remote location. The hardware and software must be procured and installed before the network can be restored. It is therefore the least expensive of the cold, warm, and hot options and takes the most time. A warm site has hardware in place that must be installed and configured. A hot site has all of the necessary hardware already installed, configured, and ready to go in the event of a disaster. A warm site is more expensive than a cold site, and a hot site is the most expensive and takes the least amount of time to be made operational.

You live in a large apartment complex, and when you run a WiFi analyzer, you see many other nearby networks using the often-recommended channels 1, 6, and 11 on the 2.4 GHz frequency. Using the 5 GHz frequency is not an option for your equipment. What should you do to improve the network's performance?\n\nA. Configure your equipment to use channel 10. B. Configure your equipment to use channel 9. C. Configure your equipment to use channel 5. D. Configure your equipment to use channel 2. ",

        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "solution": "The 2.4 GHz band used by Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) consists of channels that are 20 (or 22) MHz wide. However, the channels are only 5 MHz apart, so there is channel overlap that can result in interference. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only channels that are far enough apart from each other to avoid any overlap with the adjacent channels. This is why they are often recommended. However, in this scenario, these channels are too crowded with other networks. You should therefore use a channel that is as far as possible from the crowded ones. Channels 2, 5, and 10 are all immediately adjacent to a crowded channel, but channel 9 is at least two channels away from the nearest crowded channel. Therefore, you should configure your equipment to use channel 9",

The primary objective of the project is to provide all of the network users with access to web and email services while keeping the client computers safe from unauthorized users on the Internet. The secondary objectives of the project are to avoid having to manually configure IP addresses on each one of the client computers individually and to provide a means of monitoring and regulating the users\u2019 access to the Internet. Ralph submits a proposal calling for the use of private IP addresses on the client computers and a series of proxy servers with public, registered IP addresses, connected to the Internet using multiple T-1 lines. Which of the following statements about Ralph's proposed Internet access solution is true?\n\nA. The proposal fails to satisfy both the primary and secondary objectives. B. The proposal satisfies the primary objective but neither of the secondary objectives. C. The proposal satisfies the primary objective and one of the secondary objectives. D.

However, the proxy servers cannot assign IP addresses to the client computers, and the plan makes no mention of DHCP or another automatic TCP/IP configuration mechanism.

Each internal LAN uses twisted-pair Gigabit Ethernet links that connect the users to a switch. Each of the four switches is connected to a separate router. All four routers connect to the same backbone network, which has a single additional router to connect the company's network to the Internet, using a T-1 Wide Area Network (WAN) link. Today, users on one of the four internal LANs are reporting that when they came in this morning, they could not access the Internet or resources on the other three internal LANs. However, they could access resources on their own LAN with no problems. Which network component is the likeliest source of the problem in this scenario?\n\nA. The switch on the problem LAN B. The Internet router C. The router connecting the problem LAN to the backbone D. The cable on the backbone network ",

This isolates the problem to a component within that LAN only. Since users can connect successfully to local resources, the problem does not lie within the individual computers, the switch that connects the users to the network, or the backbone network cable. The likeliest problem is therefore in the router connecting the problem LAN to the backbone network. Since users on the other internal LANs are not reporting problems connecting to the Internet, the problem most likely does not involve the Internet router",

If the DNS server is located on Adatum's company network, then the DNS server could be failing to resolve the website names. However, the DNS server could be located on the Internet Service Provider's (ISP's) network, in which case the problem might be in the router that provides access to the ISP's network",

Setting the lease time to a shorter duration will release the IP address and make it available for a new user.

What is the first action you should take to fix the problem?\n\nA. Have the affected users restart their computers. B. Replace the USB cable. C. Clear the print queue. D. Reinstall the printer drivers on the affected users\u2019 computers. ",

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "solution": "**Explanation:** The first thing you should try (of the listed answers) is to clear the print queue. How this is done will vary depending on the type of print server being used. For example, if the printer is being controlled by a Windows Server machine, that server will have the Print Management role installed. From the Print Management console window, you can access the printer in question and locate the queue. In most client Windows operating systems (such as Windows 10 or 11), you can find the queue simply by double-clicking the printer. Regardless of the OS, it is where you would normally go to manage print jobs. Then, after you have found the queue, delete any pending or stalled jobs. One of those print jobs might have been causing a delay, possibly if the print job was too big or was corrupted. Of course, you will have to notify users that any jobs as of _x_ time frame have been deleted and will need to be printed again. On some printers, you can clear the print queue from the onscreen display (OSD) directly on the printer; an OSD is also known as an OCP (operator control panel). Or, if the print server is built into a SOHO router or similar device, you have to access it from a browser.\n\n **Incorrect answers:** If at all possible, try to solve problems centrally, without getting users involved. Having the affected users restart their computers is probably a waste of time in this case. If only one user were affected, restarting could be a viable solution, but when multiple users are affected, the problem is more likely located centrally\u2014at a server or a network device. You don\u2019t even know if the printer is connected with a USB cable. It might be if it is connected directly to the server, but it could be wired to the network with a twisted-pair patch cable. Either way, cables don\u2019t usually fail out of nowhere. This potential solution should be further down your list. Reinstalling the print drivers is not the best answer because several users were affected. Again, if only one user were affected, this might be a valid option, but if several were affected, the problem is probably more centralized",

Since no one else is experiencing a problem, the DHCP server is presumably functioning. The Subnet Mask value is correct for an APIPA address, and APIPA does not provide Default Gateway or Domain Name System (DNS) server addresses. Therefore, an exhausted DHCP scope is the only one of the explanations provided that could be the cause of the problem",

In addition, each AP has been configured to use a non-overlapping channel that is different from its adjacent neighbors. All APs have been configured to offer only the 24-, 36-, 48-, and 54-Mbps data rates; all other rates are disabled. One day, one of the APs fails and someone replaces it. Afterward, users begin to call and complain about poor performance and roaming. You discover that the problems are not occurring in the area covered by the replacement AP; instead, they are occurring about two APs away from it. Which one of the following could be causing the problem?\n\nA. The replacement AP has its radios disabled. B. The replacement AP is using a transmit level of 1 dBm. C. The replacement AP is using the 1- and 2-Mbps data rates. D. The replacement AP is new and cannot be causing the problem. ",

If the replacement had a 1-dBm transmit power, it could not be causing any interference at a great distance away. The problem is likely occurring because the lowest data rates have been enabled on the AP. The lower rates effectively extend the replacement AP\u2019s cell size into the cells of other APs farther away. If the channels are identical, the replacement could be causing co-channel interference in other cells, degrading client performance and roaming",

Many networks use a DHCP server to assign IP addresses because keeping track of them manually would create a great deal of work. If there are two identical IP addresses attempting to access a network with DHCP, then at least one of them has its IP address configured manually. Ensuring that this computer is set to obtain an IP address automatically should be your first step. If it isn't, then you have found the problem. If it is, then you could ping the IP address using `ping -a _ipaddress_`, substituting the duplicated IP address for the variable `_ipaddress_` in the command. This will return the hostname of the other computer. Every network admin should have a list of computer names and where they are located. You could then ensure that the other computer is also set to obtain an IP address automatically. Manually configuring an IP address is what caused the problem.

This WAP failure causes the laptops to fail when attempting to connect to websites; furthermore, the laptops won\u2019t have any Internet connection whatsoever. There are a lot of reasons a client computer may not be able to connect to a WAP, but if several wireless clients cannot make the connection, you can usually assume that the problem is not at the client side and instead is at the central connecting device\u2014in this case the WAP. Laptops often connect wirelessly because they are mobile devices, whereas PCs often connect in a wired fashion because they are stationary and don\u2019t necessarily need a wireless connection.\n\n **Incorrect answers:** If the PCs can connect to the Internet fine (as the question states), you can probably rule out the router, cable modem, firewall, and UTM device\u2014unless, of course, one of the devices was configured with some kind of rule stating that the laptops can\u2019t connect to websites. This is unlikely, but it is a possibility if the network has a firewall or UTM. UTM stands for unified threat management; UTM devices combine the functionality of firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and proxy servers, among other things.

A host on the network is any computer or network device that uses an IP address to communicate with other computers or devices. 172.17.58.254 is a class B private IP address, so it fits the description of a valid IPv4 address for a network host.\n\n **Incorrect answers:** 127.0.0.1 is the IPv4 local loopback address. Every computer using TCP/IP gets this address, which is used for testing. This address cannot be used to communicate with other hosts on the network. 169.254.0.0/16 means the IP address 169.254.0.0 with the default subnet mask 255.255.0.0, indicating that the network number is 169.254; it is not a valid host IP address because it ends in 0.0. The first IP address of a network is always reserved for the network number; it cannot be used by a host. Otherwise, if the address were, say, 169.254.0.1, the address would work, but because it is an APIPA address, it would be able to communicate only with other systems using APIPA addresses. 255.10.15.7 is not valid. That address is within the class E reserved range. For normal host IP addresses, the first octet is either between 1 and 126 or between 128 and 223, but it cannot be between 224 and 255",

If no domain is used, then by default Windows computers will join a workgroup called workgroup, making it easy to share files, printers, and other resources.

The drawbacks of a workgroup are that security is configured on each PC and it's only appropriate for very small networks.

        "answer": "A",
        "solution": "Wireless LAN regulations call for 22 MHz channels in the 2.4 GHz band that are spaced 5 MHz apart, which means that they overlap. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only three channels that are distant enough from each other not to overlap. Therefore, they do not interfere with each other. Channels 1, 6, and 11 do not differ from the other channels in their bandwidth or their transmission range. Each wireless device can be set to use only one channel. Therefore, channels 1, 6, and 11 cannot all be the default setting",
