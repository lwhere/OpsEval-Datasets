In a laptop, RAM is often soldered directly onto the motherboard (onboard) and isn't meant to be replaced by most users. Since the maximum system RAM is 32 GB, you would need one 16 GB RAM module to bring it up to that total.

You would likely want a global unicast address on a web server, but not on your workstation. Link-local addresses can only be used to communicate with devices that are on the same local link. They will start with fe80 and are assigned in a manner similar to IPv4 APIPA addresses. The IPv6 loopback address is ::1, and is used for testing just like the loopback address in IPv4 (127.0.0.1). A unique local address is akin to an IPv4 private address. Unique local addresses are nonroutable, so a computer with only a unique local address and a link-local address (but no global unicast address) would need a router with IPv6 NAT in order to access the Internet",

On the existing network, all users share the same 100 Mbps communication channel, and each computer must take turns transmitting. By replacing the hubs with switches, you provide each computer with a dedicated 100 Mbps connection to the switch, while reducing unnecessary traffic and collisions on the network. There is no such thing as a dedicated hub. Splitting the network into two routed LANs is not the best solution, because all users must share information on a constant basis. Also, cost is a factor, and routers are more expensive than switches. Replacing the hubs with a layer 3 switch and defining two VLANs with 20 users each is not a reasonable solution, because layer 3 switches are very expensive",

        "answer": "C",
        "solution": "**Explanation:** In DHCP, set a reservation based on the MAC address. In this scenario, the clients are most likely connecting to the printer by using the IP address. Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) can be used in this manner. By default, the moment the new printer is connected to the network, it acquires an IP address from the DHCP server; this is a new IP address that is different from the one used by the old printer. This causes the clients to fail when attempting to connect and print to the new printer. To prevent this problem, you can go to the router (or another DHCP device) and configure a MAC address reservation. The MAC address of the printer (which might be on a label or might be accessible from the onscreen display) can be plugged into the DHCP server and reserved to a specific IP address. Of course, a better option would be to simply configure the printer to use a static IP address.\n\n **Incorrect answers:** Renaming the printer with the old name doesn’t help because the client computers are most likely connecting via IP address, not via name. Printing the configuration page is great and might help you to figure out what the problem could be, but it doesn’t actually solve the problem!",

Ralph lives in a large apartment complex, and when he runs a WiFi analyzer, he sees many other nearby networks using the often-recommended channels 1, 6, and 11 on the 2.4 GHz frequency. Using the 5 GHz frequency is not an option for Ralph's equipment. What should Ralph do to improve his network performance?\n\nA. Configure his equipment to use channel 2 B.

        "answer": "C",
        "solution": "The 2.4 GHz band used by Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) consists of channels that are 20 (or 22) MHz wide. However, the channels are only 5 MHz apart, so there is channel overlap that can result in interference, possibly causing long AP association times and degraded performance. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only channels that are far enough apart from each other to avoid any overlap with the adjacent channels. This is why they are often recommended. However, in Ralph's case, these channels are too crowded with other networks. Ralph should therefore use a channel that is as far as possible from the crowded ones. Channels 2, 5, and 10 are all immediately adjacent to a crowded channel, but channel 9 is at least two channels away from the nearest crowded channel. Therefore, Ralph should configure his equipment to use channel 9",

Scaling is the network design use case that focuses on the scalability of the technology or holistic architecture in question. This could be as simple as a single flat area 0 OSPF design that just doesn’t scale anymore to the business requirements, in which case you could leverage multiple areas, multiple area types, and LSA filtering techniques to help increase the scalability. In a design failure use case, there is a problem, and you have to resolve it. For example, not aligning the critical roles of Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP). If your STP root bridge and your FHRP default gateways are not aligned to the correct devices, then you would have a suboptimal routing issue that would eventually lead to a design failure.

        "question": "Ralph is responsible for the network installation in a new building purchased by his company, and he has elected to have Category 6 (Cat 6) Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) cable installed. The company president has asked him if it is possible to run their Gigabit Ethernet network using two of the wire pairs in the cable, while using the other two pairs for telephone connections. Ralph is not sure, so he sets up a lab network using cables with only two pairs connected. When he plugs computers into the switch and turns them on, the Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) labeled 1000 light up, indicating that a Gigabit Ethernet connection has been established. Ralph gets excited at the thought of how much money he might save the company by using the same cable for both telephone and data. However, while the LED is lit, he cannot seem to connect to another system over his test network. Which of the following describes what he must do to correct the problem?\n\nA. Ralph must manually configure the network adapters to use Gigabit Ethernet, rather than let them autonegotiate. B. Ralph is using the wrong two wire pairs for the Gigabit Ethernet connection. He must rewire the connectors. C. Ralph is using the wrong pinout standard on his lab network. He must use T568A. D. Ralph must use all four wire pairs for a Gigabit Ethernet connection. ",

A cold site is just a space at a remote location. The hardware and software must be procured and installed before the network can be restored. It is therefore the least expensive of the cold, warm, and hot options and takes the most time. A warm site has hardware in place that must be installed and configured. A hot site has all of the necessary hardware already installed, configured, and ready to go in the event of a disaster. A warm site is more expensive than a cold site, and a hot site is the most expensive and takes the least amount of time to be made operational. A cloud site is a virtual facility maintained with a cloud service provider. The cloud site does not require physical space or physical hardware, so it is therefore the least expensive",

The secondary objectives of the project are to avoid having to manually configure IP addresses on each one of the client computers individually and to provide a means of monitoring and regulating the users’ access to the Internet. Ralph submits a proposal calling for the use of private IP addresses on the client computers and a series of proxy servers with public, registered IP addresses, connected to the Internet using multiple T-1 lines. Which of the following statements about Ralph's proposed Internet access solution is true?\n\nA. The proposal fails to satisfy both the primary and secondary objectives. B. The proposal satisfies the primary objective but neither of the secondary objectives. C. The proposal satisfies the primary objective and one of the secondary objectives. D. The proposal satisfies the primary objective and both of the secondary objectives. ",

            "The proposal satisfies the primary objective and both of the secondary objectives."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "solution": "Proxy servers provide network users with access to Internet services, and the unregistered IP addresses on the client computers protect them from unauthorized access by users on the Internet, which satisfies the first objective. The proxy servers also make it possible for network administrators to regulate users' access to the Internet, which satisfies one of the two secondary objectives. However, the proxy servers cannot assign IP addresses to the client computers, and the plan makes no mention of DHCP or another automatic TCP/IP configuration mechanism. Therefore, the plan does not satisfy the other secondary objective",

Setting the lease time to a shorter duration will release the IP address and make it available for a new user.

What is the first action you should take to fix the problem?\n\nA. Have the affected users restart their computers. B. Replace the USB cable. C. Clear the print queue. D. Reinstall the printer drivers on the affected users’ computers. ",

            "Reinstall the printer drivers on the affected users’ computers."
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "solution": "**Explanation:** The first thing you should try (of the listed answers) is to clear the print queue. How this is done will vary depending on the type of print server being used. For example, if the printer is being controlled by a Windows Server machine, that server will have the Print Management role installed. From the Print Management console window, you can access the printer in question and locate the queue. In most client Windows operating systems (such as Windows 10 or 11), you can find the queue simply by double-clicking the printer. Regardless of the OS, it is where you would normally go to manage print jobs. Then, after you have found the queue, delete any pending or stalled jobs. One of those print jobs might have been causing a delay, possibly if the print job was too big or was corrupted. Of course, you will have to notify users that any jobs as of _x_ time frame have been deleted and will need to be printed again. On some printers, you can clear the print queue from the onscreen display (OSD) directly on the printer; an OSD is also known as an OCP (operator control panel). Or, if the print server is built into a SOHO router or similar device, you have to access it from a browser.\n\n **Incorrect answers:** If at all possible, try to solve problems centrally, without getting users involved. Having the affected users restart their computers is probably a waste of time in this case. If only one user were affected, restarting could be a viable solution, but when multiple users are affected, the problem is more likely located centrally—at a server or a network device. You don’t even know if the printer is connected with a USB cable. It might be if it is connected directly to the server, but it could be wired to the network with a twisted-pair patch cable. Either way, cables don’t usually fail out of nowhere. This potential solution should be further down your list. Reinstalling the print drivers is not the best answer because several users were affected. Again, if only one user were affected, this might be a valid option, but if several were affected, the problem is probably more centralized",

Later, in the lunchroom, when she tries to connect her laptop to the network, she cannot see the SSID she was given in the Available Networks list, although she can see other networks. What should Alice do next to try to resolve the problem?\n\nA. Type in the WPA2 passphrase. B. Type the SSID in manually. C. Move closer to the Wireless Access Point (WAP). D. Move away from the microwave in the lunchroom. ",

            "Move away from the microwave in the lunchroom."
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "solution": "It is possible that the WAP has been configured to not broadcast the network's SSID as a security measure, so Alice should first attempt to access it by typing the SSID in manually. She would not be able to type in the WPA2 passphrase until she is connecting to the SSID. Moving the laptop closer to the WAP or away from possible sources of electromagnetic interference might be solutions to the problem, but they should not be the first thing Alice tries",

        "question": "Ed has been hired by a private company to connect two remote sites with a Wide Area Network (WAN). Each of these sites has more than 200 users, and they all need to constantly transfer files across the WAN. One of the sites has a customer database that is accessed by both sites at all hours of the day. Access to the database and other information is time sensitive and constant. The company estimates that their aggregate bandwidth needs to be approximately 40 Mbps. Management says that they need to guarantee access to this information and that money is not a factor in the WAN implementation. Which WAN technology should Ed recommend for this scenario?\n\nA. A standard modem-to-modem connection B. A T-3 dedicated leased line C. A cable television (CATV) connection D. An ADSL (Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line) connection ",

        "solution": "For this scenario, the best of the options given is a dedicated leased line connection. This is because the bandwidth requirements are constant, and the data transfer rates are high. To support the 40 Mbps data rate, Ed should recommend a T-3 dedicated leased line, running at 44.735 Mbps. Standard modem connections, CATV, and ADSL connections are all too slow",

In addition, each AP has been configured to use a non-overlapping channel that is different from its adjacent neighbors. All APs have been configured to offer only the 24-, 36-, 48-, and 54-Mbps data rates; all other rates are disabled. One day, one of the APs fails and someone replaces it. Afterward, users begin to call and complain about poor performance and roaming. You discover that the problems are not occurring in the area covered by the replacement AP; instead, they are occurring about two APs away from it. Which one of the following could be causing the problem?\n\nA. The replacement AP has its radios disabled. B. The replacement AP is using a transmit level of 1 dBm. C. The replacement AP is using the 1- and 2-Mbps data rates. D. The replacement AP is new and cannot be causing the problem. ",

If the replacement had a 1-dBm transmit power, it could not be causing any interference at a great distance away. The problem is likely occurring because the lowest data rates have been enabled on the AP. The lower rates effectively extend the replacement AP’s cell size into the cells of other APs farther away.

Many networks use a DHCP server to assign IP addresses because keeping track of them manually would create a great deal of work. If there are two identical IP addresses attempting to access a network with DHCP, then at least one of them has its IP address configured manually. Ensuring that this computer is set to obtain an IP address automatically should be your first step. If it isn't, then you have found the problem. If it is, then you could ping the IP address using `ping -a _ipaddress_`, substituting the duplicated IP address for the variable `_ipaddress_` in the command. This will return the hostname of the other computer. Every network admin should have a list of computer names and where they are located. You could then ensure that the other computer is also set to obtain an IP address automatically. Manually configuring an IP address is what caused the problem.

This WAP failure causes the laptops to fail when attempting to connect to websites; furthermore, the laptops won’t have any Internet connection whatsoever. There are a lot of reasons a client computer may not be able to connect to a WAP, but if several wireless clients cannot make the connection, you can usually assume that the problem is not at the client side and instead is at the central connecting device—in this case the WAP. Laptops often connect wirelessly because they are mobile devices, whereas PCs often connect in a wired fashion because they are stationary and don’t necessarily need a wireless connection.\n\n **Incorrect answers:** If the PCs can connect to the Internet fine (as the question states), you can probably rule out the router, cable modem, firewall, and UTM device—unless, of course, one of the devices was configured with some kind of rule stating that the laptops can’t connect to websites. This is unlikely, but it is a possibility if the network has a firewall or UTM. UTM stands for unified threat management; UTM devices combine the functionality of firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and proxy servers, among other things. UTMs and next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) are designed to integrate a variety of threat defenses into one device",

            "Set it on a sunny windowsill to reflect the signal back in."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "solution": "Wi-Fi signals are radio waves and part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The metal staircase would act like an antenna, absorbing the energy of the signal. Sofas are thick and most have metal in them that will also absorb the signal. The sunny windowsill is out in the open, but sunlight can interfere with radio signals too, and too much heat might damage the router. The best option here is on the stand in the corner of the dining room, which is in the center of the home. While you have chairs and a table there, there would likely not be as much furniture to block the signal as behind the sofa. Placement would, of course, depend on the exact situation",

By replacing the hubs with switches, you provide each computer with a dedicated 100 Mbps connection to the switch, while reducing unnecessary traffic and collisions on the network. There is no such thing as a dedicated hub. Splitting the network into two routed LANs is not the best solution, because all users must share information on a constant basis. Also, cost is a factor, and routers are more expensive than switches. Replacing the hubs with a layer 3 switch and defining two VLANs with 20 users each is not a reasonable solution, because layer 3 switches are very expensive",

Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) can be used in this manner. By default, the moment the new printer is connected to the network, it acquires an IP address from the DHCP server; this is a new IP address that is different from the one used by the old printer. This causes the clients to fail when attempting to connect and print to the new printer. To prevent this problem, you can go to the router (or another DHCP device) and configure a MAC address reservation. The MAC address of the printer (which might be on a label or might be accessible from the onscreen display) can be plugged into the DHCP server and reserved to a specific IP address. Of course, a better option would be to simply configure the printer to use a static IP address.\n\n **Incorrect answers:** Renaming the printer with the old name doesn’t help because the client computers are most likely connecting via IP address, not via name. Printing the configuration page is great and might help you to figure out what the problem could be, but it doesn’t actually solve the problem!",

        "solution": "The 2.4 GHz band used by Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) consists of channels that are 20 (or 22) MHz wide. However, the channels are only 5 MHz apart, so there is channel overlap that can result in interference, possibly causing long AP association times and degraded performance. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only channels that are far enough apart from each other to avoid any overlap with the adjacent channels. This is why they are often recommended. However, in Ralph's case, these channels are too crowded with other networks. Ralph should therefore use a channel that is as far as possible from the crowded ones. Channels 2, 5, and 10 are all immediately adjacent to a crowded channel, but channel 9 is at least two channels away from the nearest crowded channel.

Scaling is the network design use case that focuses on the scalability of the technology or holistic architecture in question. This could be as simple as a single flat area 0 OSPF design that just doesn’t scale anymore to the business requirements, in which case you could leverage multiple areas, multiple area types, and LSA filtering techniques to help increase the scalability. In a design failure use case, there is a problem, and you have to resolve it. For example, not aligning the critical roles of Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) and First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP). If your STP root bridge and your FHRP default gateways are not aligned to the correct devices, then you would have a suboptimal routing issue that would eventually lead to a design failure.

A cold site is just a space at a remote location. The hardware and software must be procured and installed before the network can be restored. It is therefore the least expensive of the cold, warm, and hot options and takes the most time. A warm site has hardware in place that must be installed and configured. A hot site has all of the necessary hardware already installed, configured, and ready to go in the event of a disaster. A warm site is more expensive than a cold site, and a hot site is the most expensive and takes the least amount of time to be made operational. A cloud site is a virtual facility maintained with a cloud service provider. The cloud site does not require physical space or physical hardware, so it is therefore the least expensive",

Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only channels that are far enough apart from each other to avoid any overlap with the adjacent channels. This is why they are often recommended. However, in this scenario, these channels are too crowded with other networks. You should therefore use a channel that is as far as possible from the crowded ones. Channels 2, 5, and 10 are all immediately adjacent to a crowded channel, but channel 9 is at least two channels away from the nearest crowded channel.

If you don't need them, remove the additional protocols, software, or services, or prevent them (disable them, or block them, as the setting is typically called on a router) from loading. Ports left open but not in use present an open door for an attacker to enter. MAC filtering is an option on most routers that will only allow devices with specific MAC addresses to access the router. Content filtering blocks undesirable traffic such as social media or hate sites on a corporate network. Port forwarding/mapping will send all traffic that comes in on a specified port number to a specific node on the network",

An open circuit would manifest as a failure to detect a tone on a wire, indicating that there is either a break in the wire somewhere inside the cable or a bad connection with the pin in one or both connectors.

        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "solution": "**Explanation:** The first thing you should try (of the listed answers) is to clear the print queue. How this is done will vary depending on the type of print server being used. For example, if the printer is being controlled by a Windows Server machine, that server will have the Print Management role installed. From the Print Management console window, you can access the printer in question and locate the queue. In most client Windows operating systems (such as Windows 10 or 11), you can find the queue simply by double-clicking the printer. Regardless of the OS, it is where you would normally go to manage print jobs. Then, after you have found the queue, delete any pending or stalled jobs. One of those print jobs might have been causing a delay, possibly if the print job was too big or was corrupted. Of course, you will have to notify users that any jobs as of _x_ time frame have been deleted and will need to be printed again. On some printers, you can clear the print queue from the onscreen display (OSD) directly on the printer; an OSD is also known as an OCP (operator control panel). Or, if the print server is built into a SOHO router or similar device, you have to access it from a browser.\n\n **Incorrect answers:** If at all possible, try to solve problems centrally, without getting users involved. Having the affected users restart their computers is probably a waste of time in this case. If only one user were affected, restarting could be a viable solution, but when multiple users are affected, the problem is more likely located centrally—at a server or a network device. You don’t even know if the printer is connected with a USB cable. It might be if it is connected directly to the server, but it could be wired to the network with a twisted-pair patch cable. Either way, cables don’t usually fail out of nowhere. This potential solution should be further down your list. Reinstalling the print drivers is not the best answer because several users were affected. Again, if only one user were affected, this might be a valid option, but if several were affected, the problem is probably more centralized",

Since no one else is experiencing a problem, the DHCP server is presumably functioning. The Subnet Mask value is correct for an APIPA address, and APIPA does not provide Default Gateway or Domain Name System (DNS) server addresses. Therefore, an exhausted DHCP scope is the only one of the explanations provided that could be the cause of the problem",

Many networks use a DHCP server to assign IP addresses because keeping track of them manually would create a great deal of work. If there are two identical IP addresses attempting to access a network with DHCP, then at least one of them has its IP address configured manually. Ensuring that this computer is set to obtain an IP address automatically should be your first step. If it isn't, then you have found the problem. If it is, then you could ping the IP address using `ping -a _ipaddress_`, substituting the duplicated IP address for the variable `_ipaddress_` in the command. This will return the hostname of the other computer. Every network admin should have a list of computer names and where they are located. You could then ensure that the other computer is also set to obtain an IP address automatically. Manually configuring an IP address is what caused the problem. The `ipconfig /release` and `ipconfig /renew` commands wouldn't help in this situation",

        "answer": "C",
        "solution": "**Explanation:** The wireless access point is most likely the problem. Perhaps it was turned off or disabled or lost its connection to the network. This WAP failure causes the laptops to fail when attempting to connect to websites; furthermore, the laptops won’t have any Internet connection whatsoever. There are a lot of reasons a client computer may not be able to connect to a WAP, but if several wireless clients cannot make the connection, you can usually assume that the problem is not at the client side and instead is at the central connecting device—in this case the WAP. Laptops often connect wirelessly because they are mobile devices, whereas PCs often connect in a wired fashion because they are stationary and don’t necessarily need a wireless connection.\n\n **Incorrect answers:** If the PCs can connect to the Internet fine (as the question states), you can probably rule out the router, cable modem, firewall, and UTM device—unless, of course, one of the devices was configured with some kind of rule stating that the laptops can’t connect to websites. This is unlikely, but it is a possibility if the network has a firewall or UTM. UTM stands for unified threat management; UTM devices combine the functionality of firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), and proxy servers, among other things. UTMs and next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) are designed to integrate a variety of threat defenses into one device",

        "answer": "C",
        "solution": "**Explanation:** Of the answers listed, 172.17.58.254 is the only valid IPv4 address for a network host. A host on the network is any computer or network device that uses an IP address to communicate with other computers or devices. 172.17.58.254 is a class B private IP address, so it fits the description of a valid IPv4 address for a network host.\n\n **Incorrect answers:** 127.0.0.1 is the IPv4 local loopback address. Every computer using TCP/IP gets this address, which is used for testing. This address cannot be used to communicate with other hosts on the network. 169.254.0.0/16 means the IP address 169.254.0.0 with the default subnet mask 255.255.0.0, indicating that the network number is 169.254; it is not a valid host IP address because it ends in 0.0. The first IP address of a network is always reserved for the network number; it cannot be used by a host. Otherwise, if the address were, say, 169.254.0.1, the address would work, but because it is an APIPA address, it would be able to communicate only with other systems using APIPA addresses. 255.10.15.7 is not valid. That address is within the class E reserved range. For normal host IP addresses, the first octet is either between 1 and 126 or between 128 and 223, but it cannot be between 224 and 255",

A short circuit is when a wire is connected to two or more pins at one end of the cable.

        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "solution": "A domain is a group of computers that are tightly connected or associated and share a common domain name. It has a single authority (called a domain controller) that manages security and access to resources for all the computers. All users will log in to the Windows domain using their centrally created user account. If no domain is used, then by default Windows computers will join a workgroup called workgroup, making it easy to share files, printers, and other resources. Access to resources is configured on each workstation that is sharing a resource. The drawbacks of a workgroup are that security is configured on each PC and it's only appropriate for very small networks. Homegroup was a networking scheme in prior versions of Windows that shared libraries. A personal area network (PAN) consists of a PC and its wireless devices, usually paired Bluetooth devices such as printers, headphones, and input devices. A domain is a network where access to resources is configured on a central server that all users of the resources must log in to",
