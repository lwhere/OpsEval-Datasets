# OpsEval Dataset

[Website](https://opseval.cstcloud.cn/content/home) | [Reporting Issues](https://github.com/NetManAIOps/OpsEval-Datasets/issues/new)

## Introduction

The OpsEval dataset represents a pioneering effort in the evaluation of Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps), focusing on the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) within this domain. In an era where IT operations are increasingly reliant on AI technologies for automation and efficiency, understanding the performance of LLMs in operational tasks becomes crucial. OpsEval offers a comprehensive task-oriented benchmark specifically designed for assessing LLMs in various crucial IT Ops scenarios.

This dataset is motivated by the emerging trend of utilizing AI in automated IT operations, as predicted by Gartner, and the remarkable capabilities exhibited by LLMs in NLP-related tasks. OpsEval aims to bridge the gap in evaluating these models' performance in AIOps tasks, including root cause analysis of failures, generation of operations and maintenance scripts, and summarizing alert information.

## Highlights

- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: OpsEval includes 7184 multi-choice questions and 1736 question-answering (QA) formats, available in both English and Chinese, making it one of the most extensive benchmarks in the AIOps domain.
- **Task-Oriented Design**: The benchmark is tailored to assess LLMs' proficiency across different crucial scenarios and ability levels, offering a nuanced view of model performance in operational contexts.
- **Expert-Reviewed**: To ensure the reliability of our evaluation, dozens of domain experts have manually reviewed our questions, providing a solid foundation for the benchmark's credibility.
- **Open-Sourced and Dynamic Leaderboard**: We have open-sourced 20% of the test QA to facilitate preliminary evaluations by researchers. An online leaderboard, updated in real-time, captures the performance of emerging LLMs, ensuring the benchmark remains current and relevant.
